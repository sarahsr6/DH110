# Connecting via Watchparties
## Heuristic Evaluation
##### Sarah Redden | DH110 User Interface and Design

The COVID-19 pandemic forced people around the world to adjust their daily routines and find new ways of staying connected with family and friends. With strict lockdowns and social distancing measures in place, many turned to the internet and online streaming apps as a means of keeping in touch and sharing experiences.

As the demand for online entertainment surged, various apps and platforms emerged to cater to the specific needs of people looking to share movies and TV shows remotely with loved ones. These apps not only allowed people to watch their favorite movies and TV shows together, but also provided a way for them to chat and socialize in real-time. Since these apps were relativiely new, there were constant updates making it occasionally difficult for users to keep up with. 

Apps such as Kast and Discord, allow people to stream content from various sources, including YouTube and Amazon Prime Video, and interact with their friends in real-time through a chat function. These apps have provided a new way for people to bond over shared interests and engage in virtual movie nights with loved ones, even when separated by distance. These apps are great ideas, but have some limitations in terms of conection.

The rise of online streaming apps and platforms during the COVID-19 pandemic has not only revolutionized the way people consume entertainment, but also provided a means of staying connected with family and friends. These apps have become a popular way for people to share experiences, enjoy movie nights together, and feel closer despite being physically apart.

We will take an in depth look at spacific apps mentioned above and see if there is any way to make streaming and connecting easier. I will do this using Jakob Nielson's 10 Usability Heuristics as desgribed below:


### [10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) 

| Number | Heuristic | Description |
|---|---|---|
| #1 | Visibility of System Status | Users should always be informed about what is going on and should be given appropriate feedback to their actions |
| #2 | Match Between System and the Real World | Use concepts and language that are familiar and logical to the user |
| #3 | User Control and Freedom | Allow users to make mistakes; give them options to undo and redo tasks |
| #4 | Consistency and Standards | Follow conventions and make sure design is consistent across the platform |
| #5 | Error Prevention | Get rid of error-prone conditions and provide users with safety nets for high-cost errors |
| #6 | Recognition Rather Than Recall | Minimize user's memory load by giving them suggestions and help in context |
| #7 | Flexibility and Efficiency of Use | Provide multiple ways to perform a task to make the platform accessible to all users |
| #8 | Aesthetic and Minimalist Design | Provide only relevant content and features |
| #9 | Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors | Tell users what the problem is and provide suggestions to fix it |
| #10 | Help and Documentation | Supply users with extra help to complete their tasks |


### [Severity Ratings](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/) for Usability Problems by Nielsen Norman Group

The following rating scale can be used to evaluate the severity of usability issues:
| Rating | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project |
| 2 | Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority |
| 3 | Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority |
