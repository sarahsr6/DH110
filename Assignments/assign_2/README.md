# Usability Testing Discord
DH110 Assignment 2 - Sarah Redden

## Intro
Discord is a free communication app designed for gamers, but it has since become popular among various communities. The app provides a platform where users can communicate through voice, video, and text messages in private or public groups, called servers. Discord has a range of features including file sharing, screen sharing, and streaming, making it a versatile tool for socializing, collaborating, and even teaching. This has become my go to app to connect with friends and stream shows, but it does have some drawbacks.

Discord has some usability issues as seen from the last assignment. Some of the main heuristic issues I discovered were its ability to use consistancy and standards, it has a rather complex design, and has a hard time with visibility of system status. I wanted to look more into these issues a bit further. For this I decided to conduct some usability testing. Since I am a more experienced user, it is hard for me to pinpoint where the issues are, but I had an idea of where to start. I decided to design 3 tasks in discord, that I knew how to do, but to a new user it may be a bit more dificult. These tasks sum up all the functions I use in discord. Then the most important part of testing these issues was finding a tester who was not so familiar with the site at all. I decided to use my mom as a testor since she has little experience with discord. Currently she uses facebook messanger to connect with family and do family group face time calls, but discord would be a good alternitive for the future for her if she finds it user friendly enough. 

Having a new user is perfect to test consistancy and design because it shows how intuitive the app itself is based on how easy or hard it is for that new user to complete the task and look for buttons. Then, that new user comes in helpful when testing the aesthetic and design. If there is too much going on, then a new user might also have difficulty finding simple actions. Finally, I also wanted to test for system status. A new user might not understand when they are in a call or message board, so I designed some tests to account for this as well.


## Testing Materials and Data
In order to test this, I wanted to create an enviornment similar to what it would be like chatting with friends from a distance. I set up a zoom call with my mom so she can do it in the confort from her own home with her own laptop. I sent her the survey link and told her to just open a google tab since I wanted to test the app from start to finish, including her opening the app. Then I had her share her screen and we pressed record on the testing video.

## Findings

Overall, this seemed to be a pretty good test which covered most every function in Discord. We covered adding and communicating with siglal friends, creating a group for multiple friends, and how to share media with everyone. The tester also did a good job at verbalizing concerns and issues she had, but was able to figure out every task eventually. This is what makes the video data a bit more helpful than the survey itself.

In ternms of consistancy and standards, it was prevalent that the tester had issues figuring out what some buttons were. She had to slowly hover over every button for the description to come up before understanding what it did. This is because Discord's symbols aren't completely standard compared to zoom or facebooks messanger.

It was also clear that discord has a rather compeles design, which overwhelmed the user at many points. There is a bright green button at the top that says "add friends". When the user was told to add a friend, it took a good long while to find the button. This was a great test for design because the button was simply at the top and very clear, but there is just so much on the page that it blends in and makes it hard to find anything, especially to a new user. 

Finally, the visiblility of system status was also verbally expressed to have caused the user difficulties. When she was in a server, she didnt really know what that meant, or that she was even in a call. This was definately problematic.

I think these tests were pretty good, but if I were to do this again, I would have a helper test the discord calls next time. It was hard for me to be in 2 calls at once on different apps, which caused some little issues. I think I would have someone on standby in a different room so they can do test calls without getting any weird feedback from calls being too close together. I would also probabably give less help to the tester and emplisize more it is ok if they cant complete the task.
