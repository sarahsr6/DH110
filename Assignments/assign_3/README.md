# Contextual Inquiry
DH110 User Experience and Design

## Project Design Challenge
The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of staying connected with loved ones while maintaining social distancing. With people being forced to stay at home, many turned to technology as a means of staying connected. However, the sudden surge in demand has led to a number of hastily put-together solutions that are often unreliable and lack user-friendliness.

To address this issue, the focus of this project is on developing an app that is specifically designed to facilitate seamless communication between friends and family members who are not physically together. The app will leverage the best aspects of existing communication platforms and incorporate new features to enhance the overall user experience.

To achieve this, the design process will involve a thorough analysis of user needs and behaviors, as well as an assessment of existing communication tools. The resulting app will be intuitive and user-friendly, with a clean and simple interface that facilitates easy navigation and use. Additionally, security and privacy will be key considerations in the development process, ensuring that users can communicate with confidence and without fear of their data being compromised.

The ultimate goal of this project is to create an app that serves as a one-stop-shop for friends and family to connect and share media, providing a reliable and easy-to-use solution for those seeking to stay connected in a digital world.

## Target Users
The success of any app depends largely on its ability to appeal to its target audience. In the case of this project, which aims to provide a simple and easy way for friends and family to connect and share media while not physically together, the target users are diverse and include people of all ages and backgrounds.

From grandparents who may be less familiar with technology, to teenagers who use social media apps on a daily basis, the app needs to cater to the unique needs and preferences of each user group. To do this, the app needs to be intuitive and user-friendly for all ages, while also offering advanced features that appeal to younger users. Additionally, it needs to be accessible and inclusive, catering to users with different abilities and disabilities. By focusing on these key factors, the app has the potential to bridge generational gaps and bring families and friends closer together.


## Research Methods
In order to conduct some research on how people typically share media and chat with friends, I decided to use conduct a contextual inquiry with my participants. I decided to conduct an interview with 2 participants and see what apps they prefer to use given certain scenarios. I came up with some questions and sectioned them into some categories which I will explain below.

Background/General questions: In this first section, I just wanted to get context from each participant. I asked them about their major and computer skills background, then also asked some questions about what they did during Covid quarentine. This sets the scene for what apps they may have used.

Observations: This is where I dove into which apps they used during quarentine. This gives an insite of their go to apps. Then I wanted to observe what their go to apps are if I gave them a scinareo. I asked what would they use if they wanted to share a movie with a friend? Then I have them each walk me through the steps to do so.

Problems: Then I asked about any problems they have with any of the apps they talked about. I also used this section to ask if there are any apps they will never attempt using as well.

These sections help get insite to the participants skill level and what apps they choose with that skill level. The interview audio, questions and my notes are attached balow.

## Interview Observations and Insights
* Users want to use what they know 
> I found that these users weren't technologically advanced, but knew how to do a good amount with computers from school and social media. However, they both explained that they would prefer to use apps they already know how to use because learning new apps is sometimes overwhelming and annoying.
* Certain tasks are so hard to do, users rather not do it than even try
* Users dont lke discord
* Want simplicity and standardization
