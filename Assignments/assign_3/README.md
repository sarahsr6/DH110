# Contextual Inquiry
DH110 User Experience and Design

## Project Design Challenge
The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of staying connected with loved ones while maintaining social distancing. With people being forced to stay at home, many turned to technology as a means of staying connected. However, the sudden surge in demand has led to a number of hastily put-together solutions that are often unreliable and lack user-friendliness.

To address this issue, the focus of this project is on developing an app that is specifically designed to facilitate seamless communication between friends and family members who are not physically together. The app will leverage the best aspects of existing communication platforms and incorporate new features to enhance the overall user experience.

To achieve this, the design process will involve a thorough analysis of user needs and behaviors, as well as an assessment of existing communication tools. The resulting app will be intuitive and user-friendly, with a clean and simple interface that facilitates easy navigation and use. Additionally, security and privacy will be key considerations in the development process, ensuring that users can communicate with confidence and without fear of their data being compromised.

The ultimate goal of this project is to create an app that serves as a one-stop-shop for friends and family to connect and share media, providing a reliable and easy-to-use solution for those seeking to stay connected in a digital world.

## Target Users
The success of any app depends largely on its ability to appeal to its target audience. In the case of this project, which aims to provide a simple and easy way for friends and family to connect and share media while not physically together, the target users are diverse and include people of all ages and backgrounds.

From grandparents who may be less familiar with technology, to teenagers who use social media apps on a daily basis, the app needs to cater to the unique needs and preferences of each user group. To do this, the app needs to be intuitive and user-friendly for all ages, while also offering advanced features that appeal to younger users. Additionally, it needs to be accessible and inclusive, catering to users with different abilities and disabilities. By focusing on these key factors, the app has the potential to bridge generational gaps and bring families and friends closer together.


## Research Methods
In order to conduct some research on how people typically share media and chat with friends, I decided to use conduct a contextual inquiry with my participants. I decided to conduct an interview with 2 participants and see what apps they prefer to use given certain scenarios. I came up with some questions and sectioned them into some categories which I will explain below.

Background/General questions: In this first section, I just wanted to get context from each participant. I asked them about their major and computer skills background, then also asked some questions about what they did during Covid quarentine. This sets the scene for what apps they may have used.

Observations: This is where I dove into which apps they used during quarentine. This gives an insite of their go to apps. Then I wanted to observe what their go to apps are if I gave them a scinareo. I asked what would they use if they wanted to share a movie with a friend? Then I have them each walk me through the steps to do so.

Problems: Then I asked about any problems they have with any of the apps they talked about. I also used this section to ask if there are any apps they will never attempt using as well.

These sections help get insite to the participants skill level and what apps they choose with that skill level. The interview audio, questions and my notes are attached balow.

## Interview Observations and Insights
Users want to use what they know 
> I found that these users weren't technologically advanced, but knew how to do a good amount with computers from school and social media. However, they both explained that they would prefer to use apps they already know how to use because learning new apps is sometimes overwhelming and annoying.

Certain tasks are so hard to do, users rather not do it than even try
> Users explained some things they did over quarentene and it seemed like they veered away from online social tasks. They explained they would want to share movies with their friends, but it was too hard for them to even want to figure out, so they would rather just not do it at all.

Novice users dont lke discord
> They both explained that discord was an app they would never want to touch. They even had some experience with it from some classes, but never want to try it again because it was just too confusing and not sensical to them. They would prefer using multiple different apps than attemp discord which has it all. This was surprising to me because I thought that would be a go to app for movie sharing, but they explained they would rather not share than try discord.

Want simplicity and standardization
> They said they are open to teying new apps, like zoom was new to them both at the beginning of covid and whatsapp. But they are more willing to stick those and learn those apps because they are more straightforeward and easy to learn. I think this is because they are more standardized in terms of buttons and functionality.

## Reflection
The contextual inquiry I conducted seemed to be successful in providing insights into how people typically share media and chat with friends. Through the interview, I was able to identify the participants' preferred apps and how they typically use them in different scenarios. However, I was very surprised by the results because the apps they liked and disliked were far different than what I expected or have experienced myself.

One key insight from the interview is that users prefer to use apps they are already familiar with rather than learning new ones. This suggests that app developers should prioritize making their apps more user-friendly and easy to learn in order to encourage adoption by a wider range of users.

Another interesting observation from the interview is that some users may avoid certain social tasks, such as sharing movies with friends, if they perceive them as too difficult or confusing. This highlights the importance of designing social apps that are intuitive and easy to use, especially for less tech-savvy users.

Finally, the participants' dislike of Discord, despite its reputation as a popular app for sharing media with friends. This suggests that there is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to social apps. Developers should strive to create a variety of apps with different functionalities and designs to cater to the diverse needs and preferences of users. While discord does have the approach to display everything for users to see, there are some drawbacks when it comes to new users learning the app.

Overall, my research provided valuable insights into user behavior and preferences when it comes to social media and media sharing apps. My use of a contextual inquiry allowed for a deeper understanding of the participants' attitudes and experiences, which can inform future app development and design decisions.
