## Project Design Challenge
The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of staying connected with loved ones while maintaining social distancing. With people being forced to stay at home, many turned to technology as a means of staying connected. However, the sudden surge in demand has led to a number of hastily put-together solutions that are often unreliable and lack user-friendliness.

To address this issue, the focus of this project is on developing an app that is specifically designed to facilitate seamless communication between friends and family members who are not physically together. The app will leverage the best aspects of existing communication platforms and incorporate new features to enhance the overall user experience.

To achieve this, the design process will involve a thorough analysis of user needs and behaviors, as well as an assessment of existing communication tools. The resulting app will be intuitive and user-friendly, with a clean and simple interface that facilitates easy navigation and use. Additionally, security and privacy will be key considerations in the development process, ensuring that users can communicate with confidence and without fear of their data being compromised.

The ultimate goal of this project is to create an app that serves as a one-stop-shop for friends and family to connect and share media, providing a reliable and easy-to-use solution for those seeking to stay connected in a digital world.

## Target Users
The success of any app depends largely on its ability to appeal to its target audience. In the case of this project, which aims to provide a simple and easy way for friends and family to connect and share media while not physically together, the target users are diverse and include people of all ages and backgrounds.

From grandparents who may be less familiar with technology, to teenagers who use social media apps on a daily basis, the app needs to cater to the unique needs and preferences of each user group. To do this, the app needs to be intuitive and user-friendly for all ages, while also offering advanced features that appeal to younger users. Additionally, it needs to be accessible and inclusive, catering to users with different abilities and disabilities. By focusing on these key factors, the app has the potential to bridge generational gaps and bring families and friends closer together.
