# Assignment #6: Interface Design

DH 110: User Experience and Design

Sarah Redden


## Introduction
For my project I developed an app called Tele-Watch Party. It is a social app designed to help people of all ages stay connected with their friends and family. With this app, users can create groups, chat, and join group calls, making it easy to catch up with loved ones from anywhere in the world. In those groups, this app makes it easy to share movies with friends while in a group call. 

Last week I designed an overall layout of how the app works and gave a rouch wireframe example to show how the flow works which can be seen [here](https://sarah398878.invisionapp.com/freehand/Proj-5-pObe8fZlr) or in assignment 5.
