# Tele-Watch Party App
by Sarah Redden

hi

## Introduction: 

The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of staying connected with loved ones while maintaining social distancing. With people being forced to stay at home, many turned to technology as a means of staying connected. However, the sudden surge in demand has led to a number of hastily put-together solutions that are often unreliable and lack user-friendliness.

To address this issue, the focus of this project is on developing an app that is specifically designed to facilitate seamless communication between friends and family members who are not physically together. The app will leverage the best aspects of existing communication platforms and incorporate new features to enhance the overall user experience.

To achieve this, the design process will involve a thorough analysis of user needs and behaviors, as well as an assessment of existing communication tools. The resulting app will be intuitive and user-friendly, with a clean and simple interface that facilitates easy navigation and use. Additionally, security and privacy will be key considerations in the development process, ensuring that users can communicate with confidence and without fear of their data being compromised.

The ultimate goal of this project is to create an app that serves as a one-stop-shop for friends and family to connect and share media, providing a reliable and easy-to-use solution for those seeking to stay connected in a digital world.




## Design statement: 
What is the issue and Why do you think it is important to resolve that issue by your project? 
For my project I developed an app called Tele-Watch Party. It is a social app designed to help people of all ages stay connected with their friends and family. With this app, users can create groups, chat, and join group calls, making it easy to catch up with loved ones from anywhere in the world. One of the standout features of Tele-Watch Party is its Tele-Watch button, which allows users to share movies or shows from popular streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, or HBO Max. This means that users can watch their favorite shows together in real-time, no matter where they are located. They can also do this while on a call, which isnt popular in any apps currently.

Recently, I conducted some user research on some similar competitor apps currently availible. After various testing I found that there are some major problems that make it very difficult for users to share shows:

* Some apps like discord are more complecated, which turns users awat from even trying.
* Ohter apps like zoom don't provide steps to get arould the blocking features streaming apps have to prevent users from sharing their screen
* Apps made specifically for sharing movies don't allow for calls at the same time. They just include a chat message feature
* 
I wanted to take these problems into consideration when designing this new app geared specifically for media sharing. I wanted to make it simple, and as intuitive as possible. In order to do that, I conducted research testing alongside developement.
