# Tele-Watch Party App
by Sarah Redden

## Introduction: 

The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of staying connected with loved ones while maintaining social distancing. With people being forced to stay at home, many turned to technology as a means of staying connected. However, the sudden surge in demand has led to a number of hastily put-together solutions that are often unreliable and lack user-friendliness.

To address this issue, the focus of this project is on developing an app that is specifically designed to facilitate seamless communication between friends and family members who are not physically together. The app will leverage the best aspects of existing communication platforms and incorporate new features to enhance the overall user experience.

To achieve this, the design process will involve a thorough analysis of user needs and behaviors, as well as an assessment of existing communication tools. The resulting app will be intuitive and user-friendly, with a clean and simple interface that facilitates easy navigation and use. Additionally, security and privacy will be key considerations in the development process, ensuring that users can communicate with confidence and without fear of their data being compromised.

The ultimate goal of this project is to create an app that serves as a one-stop-shop for friends and family to connect and share media, providing a reliable and easy-to-use solution for those seeking to stay connected in a digital world.




## Design statement: 
What is the issue and Why do you think it is important to resolve that issue by your project? 
For my project I developed an app called Tele-Watch Party. It is a social app designed to help people of all ages stay connected with their friends and family. With this app, users can create groups, chat, and join group calls, making it easy to catch up with loved ones from anywhere in the world. One of the standout features of Tele-Watch Party is its Tele-Watch button, which allows users to share movies or shows from popular streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, or HBO Max. This means that users can watch their favorite shows together in real-time, no matter where they are located. They can also do this while on a call, which isnt popular in any apps currently.

Recently, I conducted some user research on some similar competitor apps currently availible. After various testing I found that there are some major problems that make it very difficult for users to share shows:

* Some apps like discord are more complecated, which turns users awat from even trying.
* Ohter apps like zoom don't provide steps to get arould the blocking features streaming apps have to prevent users from sharing their screen
* Apps made specifically for sharing movies don't allow for calls at the same time. They just include a chat message feature
* 
I wanted to take these problems into consideration when designing this new app geared specifically for media sharing. I wanted to make it simple, and as intuitive as possible. In order to do that, I conducted research testing alongside developement.


## Competitor analysis [assignment01 & 02]:
Cmpeting apps such as Kast and Discord, allow people to stream content from various sources, including YouTube and Amazon Prime Video, and interact with their friends in real-time through a chat function. These apps have provided a new way for people to bond over shared interests and engage in virtual movie nights with loved ones, even when separated by distance. These apps are great ideas, but have some limitations in terms of conection.

The rise of online streaming apps and platforms during the COVID-19 pandemic has not only revolutionized the way people consume entertainment, but also provided a means of staying connected with family and friends. These apps have become a popular way for people to share experiences, enjoy movie nights together, and feel closer despite being physically apart.

I conducted some research on these existing apps using Jakob Nielson's 10 Usability Heuristics which can be found in the link below:

I also cinducted some live usability testing to see what users are looking for in these apps and what is currently wrong with them:

## User research [contextual inquiry, assignment04]:
In order to conduct some research on how people typically share media and chat with friends, I decided to use conduct a contextual inquiry with my participants. I decided to conduct an interview with 2 participants and see what apps they prefer to use given certain scenarios. The link to this research can be found here:

## UX storytelling [persona+scenario, assignment05]
User Experience (UX) storytelling is a technique used in designing and creating digital products and services that aim to engage users by appealing to their emotions, needs, and desires. It is the art of crafting a narrative that connects users with a product or service, and it is a crucial part of UX design. The purpose of UX storytelling is to create a user-centered design approach that prioritizes empathy and understanding of the user's needs, preferences, and behaviors. This approach allows designers to create more engaging and meaningful experiences that connect with users on a deeper level, which ultimately leads to higher user satisfaction, loyalty, and retention. In this way, UX storytelling is an essential tool for designers seeking to create digital products and services that are both functional and emotionally impactful.

I created some personas and empathy maps of the demographics that would be usong my app. For example:

These personas help show what users may be in need for my tele watch app. The full story can be seen here. [Click Here](https://github.com/sarahsr6/DH110/tree/main/Assignments/assign_4)


## Wireframe Sketch / Low Fidelity Prototype
Creating a low fidelity prototype is an important step in the app development process. It allows you to quickly test and validate your ideas before investing too much time or money in the development process. By creating a low fidelity prototype, you can get user feedback early on and make changes as needed, without wasting resources.

A low fidelity prototype like the wireframe I created for Tele-Watch Party is an excellent way to get user input. It allows me to show the idea to potential users and gather feedback on the concept, features, and overall usability of the app. This feedback can then be used to improve the app and create a better user experience.

I drew up a wireframe and wireflow, which I then tested with some users in order to get some feedback for futher developement. Creating a low fidelity prototype is an essential step in the app development process, as it allows me to test my ideas and gather feedback from potential users.

## graphic design element variation 
Interface and graphic design is important because it is a main factor contributing to user-friendlyness. The goal is to turn our low fidelity designs into a digitized design with a more developed style. This is achieved through color palletes, shape variations, and typographic variations. The dimentions of the frame for the app was done so using an iphone 14 screen size in an online design program called Figma. Figma is what i used to create more detailed wireframes, but for now I will get into some design choices I've had to make before continuing. Figma allowed me to easily keep all the design choices availible for me to make more frames in the future.

I created a light and dark mode after extensive research with collor pallete and spacing. The final product is below:

## High-fidelity prototype (functional/interactive prototype, assignment08)
In order to get to this stage, I started with an idea, created a low fidelity prototype, conducted multiple rounds of testing, then finally created the high fidelity prototype in figma. After designing the colors and layouts of each screen, figma allowed me to also make the prototype interactive with some buttons that will allow me to test outthe flow later.

In this phase of testing, I have made three tasks on my app interactive. I tested the flow of my app and usability with these tasks. First I tested if users can figure out how to create a new group. Then I tested to see if thay can easily figure out how to share a streaming site with friends. Finally checked if they were able to end the call and log out. Since my app is interactive now, it will be like we are testing the real app while still being able to make changes in design if things still need to be changed.
