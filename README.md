# DH110 Project: Connecting via Watchparties 

##### Sarah Redden

When people had to social distance and stay home, there was a great need to find online activities to stay in touch with friends while staying safe. Phone calls are ok, but people need activities to take up the endless amount of time it felt we all had. One of my favorite things to do when I want to relax is watch a good movie or show with friends. However, that wasn't possible in quarentine. Instead we would use apps to share our streaming shows with eachother, but they had some faults that made it difficult sometimes. 

Many movie lovers sould still fid apps like these useful today beacuse it can be more convinient, or still helps when we want to isolate if we are sick. My project will take a look into some current apps that offer this service, and see if there are ways to improve.
