      <p> This project was conducted as part of a Spring 2023 Digital Humanities course (DH110: User Experience Design) at UCLA. I went through a research-informed design process to create an enjoyable and intuitive way for users to archive and look back on family memories alongside loved ones. </p>

        <p class="card-text"> Currently we live in the age of digitization where most of our recent photos are stored within our phones. The film photos, vhs tapes, and documents our older family members hold onto catch dust in family albums or multitudes of boxes stored in the attic. Most users have to call their grandparents for old yearbook photos of their parents or dig through their family albums to find a baby photo of themselves. Furthermore, while there are many cloud-sharing apps (eg. Google Photos, DropBox, etc.), none of them offer a particular creative and enjoyable way to organize a family archive, and feel more like digital boxes in the attic that carries hundreds of photos a user might never look back on.  <br><br> 

        My project aims to support users in telling a story about their families and keeping track of their lineage. Users can collaborate with other family members to create and add to a family archive. This app would be accessible to people of different ages, backgrounds, and family structures. I want to create an app that encourages users to engage with their family memories in an enjoyable and intuitive way, and build a family history that their future generations can look back on.

            <p class="card-text"> To get a sense of how users might choose to record family memories, I conducted a heuristic evaluation (using Jakob Nielson's 10 Heuristics) of the websites Collectionaire and MyStoriesMatter. I chose to analyze these two sites because they represented two very different approaches to family memories. Collectionaire uses a family tree and users can access albums specific to each family member. MyStoriesMatter is more like a social media platform specific to family members, where users can share journal entries about any stories or thoughts they have with their family.  <br><br>
            
            By evaluating them against the heuristics, I saw how users can act as both storytellers and historians for their families. From these two websites, I wanted to balance intuitive functionalities with creativity, making sure the app is simple enough for any user from any age bracket can understand while also giving them the oppurtunity to explore their family history in different ways.

            <p class="card-text"> The purpose of usability testing is to identify any issues within the design and interface of the produce by observing users. By gathering feedback from users on the website Collectionaire, I gained a better understanding of their needs and what needs to be improved to increase the site's effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.  <br><br>
            
            In my pilot UT, I tested for tasks using Collectionaire's photo storage, family tree, and sharing features. I learned from my participant the family tree editor wasn't too intuitive and the vocabulary used for some options was difficult to understand.

            <p class="card-text">To learn more about my target users, I conducted a contextual inquiry with my friend over Zoom who was comfortable with sharing information about her family with me and asked her about how she goes about recording and viewing her family memories. I asked the user to sketch how they would organize their family tree and what a typical family album layout looks like to them. <br><br>

            Some interesting insights I learned is they like to record personal keepsakes alongside their photos (eg. train tickets, candy wrappers) and they prefer to group memories based on who is in the picture rather than by individual members. From this inquiry, I thought about including features such as scanning and tagging specific family members in an archive entry.

            <p class="card-text">UX storytelling helps researchers stay in touch with their users and is a great practice of user-centered design. It helps filter out any biases by reflecting on the user's background, feelings, and motivations. Creating different personas and scenarios, I was able to gain a more thorough understanding of my target users by viewing them from various perspectives and empathizing with their frustrations and desires. <br><br>

            To create an accessible and easy to use platform for family archival, I must develop more empathy towards my target users. Drawing from my contextual inquiry and usability testing findings, I created two personas that captured how users from different backgrounds and ages interact with their family memories and their motivations for using the product.

            <p class="card-text"> Based on my personas, I came up with a low-fidelity prototype that implements four different features. <br><br>
            •	Explore and record their family lineage with a family tree <br>
            •	Build and add on to the family archive with entries by uploading or scanning media directly <br>
            •	View a timelapse of each family member through their profile <br> 
            • Invite other family members to be able to view and edit the archive <br><br>
            I had a participant test the flows in my low-fidelity prototype to identify any major issues with the user flows which guided me on how to make the product more intuitive. I also learned about some additional features they wanted to see and how it could improve the experience of exploring a family archive.

        <div class="p-4">
       <h5 class="card-title"> What I learned throughout the process</h5>
          <p class="card-text"> 
            1. Graphical interface accessibility: <br>
               Designing the app was a lot more technical than I expected and great learning experience about the factors I must consider when designing an accessible interface. The user interface is more than aesthetics, it is what drives the features to be accessible and intuitive for a user. Color contrast checking, easily readable and ledgible typography, and an organized layout are all things I will consider in my future projects. I also learned the importance of utilizing tools within Figma, such as components and layout grids, to make the design much more consistent and professional. <br><br>
            2. Empathizing with users: <br>
               I realized how easy it is to get into your own head during the design process. I could find a feature to be particularly easy because I designed it myself, but I have to consider the first-time experience of a user and what they particularly find intuitive. My mental models are biased so always seeking user feedback is important to improving the designs. <br><br>
            3. Research and reiterate: <br> 
               One main thing I wished I got to do was conduct usability tests with my high-fidelity prototype. The cognitive walkthroughs and the impression tests were very helpful, and made me realize how important it is to constantly get feedback on the UX designs and create improved iterations. The best feedback comes from users themselves and interacting with them will help me empathize with them more and change the design to enhance their experiences. In the future, I would consider making the search archives and filtering features interactive on the prototype and investigating that with usability tests and cognitive walkthroughs. <br><br>
